    - register, log in and log out
    - add, edit and delete own events, choose a category for events (party, sits, appro, excursion,      
      cruise, sports, meeting/hangout), and possibly rank event on an alcohol scale from 1 to 5, based on how         much alcohol will presumably be consumed
    - sign up for events and cancel sign ups
    - see information of all future events and list of signed up members
    - search events based on category
- Website has a profile page, with future and past events that user has organized and signed up for, potential    payment information of events
- Events as primary data items and sign ups as secondary data items
